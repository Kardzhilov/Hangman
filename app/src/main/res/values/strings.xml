        This is a normal game of "Hangman" where you get 6 wrong guesses before you loose(head, body, arm, arm, leg, leg). \n
    In case you do not know the rules of Hangman they are as follows: \n
        \t You are presented with a number of underscores each representing a letter that combined make a word or phrase. \n
        \t Your job is to guess the word or phrase by guessing letters that it might contain, and in this version you can only make 6 wrong guesses before you loose.</string>
